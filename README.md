#  Mana Tide

**Mana Tide** is a relaxing pixel art simulation game where players raise a growing colony of manatees in magical underwater lagoons. Inspired by *My Singing Monsters*, the game focuses on relaxation, exploration, and the natural beauty of the ocean, blending casual breeding mechanics with soft interaction and ambient storytelling.

---

##  Game Overview

In **Mana Tide**, players start with a small group of base manatees, each tied to specific elemental traits like sand, algae, light, mud, or magic. By feeding and leveling them up, players can breed them to discover unique combinations and expand their living ecosystem across multiple distinct underwater biomes.
